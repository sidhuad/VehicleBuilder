# Lets Build a Vehicle

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)

## Description

- **Motivation**: The motivation behind this Vehicle Builder Node.js Project was to create an interactive, user-friendly tool that mimics the process of building and managing vehicles, providing an opportunity to explore key concepts in object-oriented programming and develop a deeper understanding of how to implement these concepts in real-world applications.
- **Why build This Project**: The project was both a learning experience and a practical application of various programming principles. It allowed me to experiment with new technologies and concepts while creating something fun and engaging, simulating a real-world system of building and managing vehicles.
- **What problem's did it solve**: The project required me to solve a series of logical and technical challenges, such as enforcing vehicle constraints (e.g., towing capacity), ensuring type safety, and allowing users to perform actions based on user input. It helped me hone my problem-solving skills while implementing features that mimic the real-world behavior of vehicles.
- **Lesson's Learned**: As a developer, I wanted to dive deeper into TypeScript and its strong typing system. By building this project, I was able to practice TypeScript's features such as class inheritance, interfaces, and type safety, while also integrating it with the Node.js environment.I aimed to explore polymorphism, a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). By designing different vehicle types (e.g., Cars, Trucks, and Motorbikes) that inherit from a common base class, I was able to implement shared behaviors and methods with specific variations for each vehicle type.Through this project, I was able to gain hands-on experience with Node.js and use it effectively to build a back-end application with a simple CLI. It gave me a better understanding of how to structure a Node.js project and how to work with external dependencies, such as Inquirer.js.
- **What makes your project stand-out**: The project fully leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. By defining a common base class for vehicles and extending it into specialized vehicle types like Truck, Motorbike, and Car, the project mimics real-world object interactions. The use of polymorphic methods to handle different vehicle behaviors is a key feature that showcases how inheritance and method overriding can be effectively applied in TypeScript.The combination of TypeScript and Node.js in this project brings a modern, type-safe approach to backend development. TypeScriptâ€™s static typing provides safety and clarity, which reduces runtime errors and improves code maintainability. The use of TypeScript for classes, interfaces, and strict typing in the CLI project ensures a more structured and scalable solution.
